# dsp.so goes over as a NEW FILE and is then renamed into place. Writing
# straight onto it corrupts the mapping of a copy that is already loaded --
# the process keeps the inode, and scp truncates and rewrites that same
# inode under it. A rename swaps the directory entry instead, so anything
# still running holds the old inode until it lets go.
#
# help.json ships too. It did not, which is how the module's help went stale
# on the device while being correct in the repo.
