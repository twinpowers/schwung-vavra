"""Score the audio battery captured by tests/audio_battery.sh.

The module is compared against an OFFLINE render of the same engine driven
directly -- no fork, no ring, no gain -- so what is under test is this
module's own audio path and its preset/part handling, not the emulator.

Identity is spectral, not sample-exact, because the emulator is not
reproducible: mqLib runs the 68k in m_ucThread and the DSP in a DSPThread and
their interleaving moves the output. Two renders of the SAME preset differ by
1.4-5.0 on this metric, so a capture must match its own reference well inside
that and beat every other reference by 2x."""
